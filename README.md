**Technologies:** Spinnaker, ArgoCD, Terraform, AWS/GCP, Python  
**Description:** Building dynamic CI/CD pipelines with security validations using Trivy and automatic deployment to Kubernetes using GitOps with ArgoCD.

📂 [See Project](./cicd-spinnaker-gitops)

---

### 3️⃣ Blockchain Validators in Kubernetes
**Technologies:** Ethereum, Cosmos SDK, Kubernetes, Terraform, Go/Rust  
**Description:** Deployment of Ethereum or Cosmos validator nodes in a Kubernetes cluster with high availability, reinforced security (HashiCorp Vault for private keys, monitoring with Prometheus).

📂 [See Project](./blockchain-validators)

---

### 4️⃣ Observability Platform with OpenTelemetry + Prometheus
**Technologies:** OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Python  
**Description:** Implementation of an observability platform with distributed traceability, logs and metrics, capturing microservices traffic with OpenTelemetry and generating alerts with Prometheus.

📂 [See Project](./observability-opentelemetry)

---

### 5️⃣ AI Model Deployment with Kubernetes and Istio
**Technologies:** Kubernetes, Istio, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Rust/Python  
**Description:** Deployed AI models in a Kubernetes cluster using Istio for traffic control, load balancing and security with mTLS.
